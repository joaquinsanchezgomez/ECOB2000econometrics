# First Homework
Material related to Statistics and Introduction to Econometrics (CCNY-CUNY).
### First Homework
1.  What are the names of the people in your study group?
   
   Nicholas Esposito,
    Collin Rafferty,
    Tanmay Thomas,
    Kyle Zhou,
    Kim Fai Chan,
    Joaquin Sanchez Gomez (me)
    
2.  *this is due before class* During class on Thursday Sept 2, we’ll do
    experiments on sequences of random numbers. I gave out dice in first
    class, for you to play with sanding, filing, heating, drilling,
    gluing, squeezing or whatever to see if you can adjust which numbers
    come up. Before class, you should have done about 20 experiments
    where you roll the dice and record whether the result was a 6 or
    not.
   
   _I sanded and heated one dice to have two groups, one with a normal 
    one and the other one "adjusted". I rolled the dice 20 times together 
    and registered the results in an excel file._
    
3.  Open up R (on laptop or cloud). Replicate the commands given in the
    lecture notes *R Basics for Lecture 1* to do some simple stats on
    the PUMS-NY data. Those notes request that you find average ages for
    men and women after accounting for the top-coding. Tell me something
    else interesting, that you learned from the data, for example about
    educational attainments in different neighborhoods in the city. Are
    there surprises for you?
    
    _It is the first time I used PUMS, and I found to many variables that could
    usefull to build socio-economic indicators for New York City. For example
    we can see the average income by neighborhood and matching it with
    ethnical and racial characterictics; this is the main input to draw
    a map of how inequality is geographicaly distributed in the city_
    
4.  Differences in means can be complicated. Find the mean return on
    SP500 index (choose a time period). What is the mean return on days
    when the previous day’s return was positive? When the previous 2
    days were positive? Negative? Now read about “hot hands fallacy” and
    tell if you think that helps investment strategy. (You might start
    with [this
    tweet](https://twitter.com/profnoto/status/992466904475455489?lang=en),
    and read the papers referenced.)
    
    I downloaded an SP500 series from 2018 to the most recent available data and
    calculated the average return rate for five different periods:
    2018, 2019, 2020, 2018 to most recent, and for the last week.
    What I see is path on increasing returns, except during 2020 on the most
    difficult months for business.
